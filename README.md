# Kairox

**Verifiable Distributed Log Analysis using Cairo Proofs**

Kairox is an academic proof‑of‑concept project that demonstrates how large‑scale RFC-5424 style system logs can be analyzed in a **distributed manner** while still producing **cryptographic guarantees** about the correctness of the analysis using **Cairo / STARK proofs**.

The core idea is simple:

* Raw log files are processed off‑chain (for scalability)
* Each worker generates a **verifiable proof** that it analyzed its assigned log chunk correctly
* Proofs are **recursively aggregated** into a single final proof
* The final proof attests that the reported results genuinely correspond to the original logs, without trusting the workers

This project is built for **Parallel & Distributed Computing (PDC)** and **Zero‑Knowledge / Verifiable Computation** coursework.

## Problem Statement

Security labs and SOCs often collect massive volumes of Linux logs (e.g., RFC 5424 syslog format). Centralized analysis becomes slow and unverifiable, while distributed analysis introduces a **trust problem**: how do we know workers didn’t tamper with results?

Kairox solves this by combining:

* Distributed log parsing
* Deterministic computation in Cairo
* STARK proofs for correctness

---

## What This Project Proves

The final proof generated by Kairox proves that:

* The analyzed statistics (e.g., severity, facility)
* Were computed **according to a fixed, public algorithm**
* Over a dataset **cryptographically bound** via Merkle roots
* Without trusting the Python scripts or worker machines

Anyone can independently verify the proof.

## High‑Level Architecture

1. **Log Preprocessing (Python)**

   * Parses RFC 5424‑style system logs
   * Splits logs into chunks
   * Builds Merkle trees over raw log entries
   * Outputs structured inputs for Cairo programs

2. **Worker Cairo Programs**

   * Each worker receives:

     * Parsed log data
     * Merkle root of its assigned chunk
   * Computes log analysis deterministically
   * Produces a STARK proof

3. **Recursive Aggregation**

   * Individual worker proofs are aggregated
   * Final proof represents the entire dataset

4. **Verification**

   * Anyone can verify the final proof
   * No access to raw logs required

## Why Python Is Still Used

Python is used **only for preprocessing**, not for trust.

* Python output is treated as **untrusted input**
* Cairo enforces correctness
* Any malicious modification to parsed data would cause proof verification to fail

Trust is placed in cryptography, not scripts.
